// Package defaults houses default implementations for the very many
// interfaces that authboss has. It's a goal of the defaults package
// to provide the core where authboss implements the shell.
//
// It's simultaneously supposed to be possible to take as many or
// as few of these implementations as you desire, allowing you to
// reimplement where necessary, but reuse where possible.
